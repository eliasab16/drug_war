                                                       on fighting drugs, including on treatment and on domestic and international interdiction,
                                                       has been on an upward trend. The data at hand, which covers 1995 through 2019, show that
                                                       total spending has spiked from around $7 billion to over $36 billion. 
                                                       
                                                       Other data, provided by government agencies, covering almost the same time period, suggest that
                                                       spending is not mitigating the drug crisis, but it might be making it worse. First, 
                                                       running total spending and total overdose deaths trends on the same plot shows us that as law
                                                       enforcement and treatment spending was increasing, deaths from drug overdose were continuously
                                                       rising, reaching an all-time high of over 70 thousand deaths in 2017. Second, we have seen that
                                                       production of heroin in Mexico, the primary source of the illegal drug in U.S. markets, according to
                                                       a Department of Justice's 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment report, has also been on the rise, despite
                                                       the increased spending on prevention: estimates show that heroin production in Mexican labs has increased
                                                       around 1600% from 1999/2000 to 2017/2018. Finally, when we plotted a regression between drug control spending
                                                       and drug potency/purity, we got a positive regression line. The correlation coefficient was positive and
                                                       strong in both cases of running total spending against the purity of methamphetamine and the concentration
                                                       of Delta-9 THC in cannabis, around +0.81 and +0.92, respectively.
                                                       
                                                       Although we should not interpret these correlations as establishing causation relationships, they, nonetheless,
                                                       corroborate the Iron Law of Prohibition, which we mentioned at the beginning of the project. And at the least, what
                                                       we can safely conclude is that increased spending on drug control is not showing any effective results.")
